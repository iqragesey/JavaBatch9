Overriding: when we have the same methods in parent and child classes
RULES:
-there should a parent/child relationship (inheritance) between the classes
-the return type, name and parameters of the method should be the same
-we cannot override private methods because they don't participate in inheritance
-we cannot decrease the visibility of a method being overwritten but we can increase
-when it comes to static methods, we say we are redeclaring the method instead of overriding it
