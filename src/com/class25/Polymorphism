Polymorphism is one of the OOPs features that allows us to perform a single action in different ways
-capability of a method to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon
-important usage: occurs in OOPs, how a parent class refers to a child class object

two ways:
1. compile time polymorphism/static binding though overloading
2. run time polymorphism/dynamic binding through overriding


type casting in Java: assigning a value of one type to a variable as another type
2 types:
widening
narrowing
