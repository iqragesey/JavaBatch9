Overriding: When the same method with the same return type and same signature (name, parameters)exists in two classes
which have an inheritance relationship (parent/child)

We cannot override a static method BUT we can "hide" it by redeclaring it which is just
renaming the method

main method cannot be overridden but can be overloaded. because it's static, we use the term/concept of hiding
